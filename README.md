# 3. Dependency
Whatever static http server support php with mysql is ok.

anyway I use php-mysql and php built in server.

`php -S 0.0.0.0:80 -t docs`

# 4. Build
It doesn't need to compile or build.

just serve `docs` directory as root directory

# 5. Database server
It uses database server as AWS RDS(mysql) at 

`xscheduler.c4l3nt5dolim.ap-northeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306`

you can connect with mysql cli client via

`mysql -u root -p -h xscheduler.c4l3nt5dolim.ap-northeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com`
